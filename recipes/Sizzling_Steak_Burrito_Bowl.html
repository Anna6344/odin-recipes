        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, warmed</li>
        <li>1 (6.8 ounce) package Spanish-style rice mix (such as Rice-A-Roni®)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons margarine</li>
        <li>1 avocado, cut into wedges</li>
        <li>3 Roma tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded lettuce</li>
        <li>¾ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 lime, cut into wedges</li>
        <li>1 jalapeno pepper, diced</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>1 cup pinto beans, drained</li>
        <li>1 cup Southwest-style corn with poblano and red peppers, drained</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place beef in a gallon-size resealable plastic bag. Add carne asada marinade, 1 tablespoon adobo sauce, and steak seasoning. Seal and place in refrigerator to marinate for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Combine ranch dressing, chipotle pepper, and 1 teaspoon adobo sauce in a small bowl until well mixed. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate dressing until ready to assemble meal.</li>
        <li>Combine water, diced tomato mix, Spanish rice mix, and margarine in a large skillet. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place avocado, tomatoes, onion, lettuce, Cheddar cheese, lime, jalapeno pepper, and cilantro in individual ramekins or little bowls as burrito fixings.</li>
        <li>Place pinto beans and corn in individual microwave-safe bowls. Heat in microwave until warm, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat a ridged grill pan over medium-high heat. Grease lightly with oil.</li>
        <li>Drain and discard marinade from the beef, if necessary. Cook on the grill pan until medium-rare, hot and slightly pink in the center, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer beef to a plate.</li>
        <li>Serve beef alongside the rice, burrito fixings, pinto beans, and corn as make-your-own bowls, or divide rice into serving bowls and top with the fixings. Drizzle with the chipotle dressing.</li>
    </ol>
