    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A delicious chicken pie made from scratch with carrots, peas, and celery in a pre-made crust. Add thyme and poultry seasoning for more flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cubed</p>
            <p><em>Boneless, skinless chicken breasts (cut into cubes) are ideal for making classic chicken pot pie.</em></p></li>
        <li><p>1 cup sliced carrots</p>
            <p>1 cup frozen green peas</p>
            <p>½ cup sliced celery</p>
            <p>⅓ cup chopped onion</p>
            <p><em>This chicken pot pie recipe calls for the usual suspects: peas, carrots, onions, and celery. You could toss in some mushrooms or green peppers if you want to incorporate more veggies.</em></p></li>
        <li><p>⅓ cup butter</p>
            <p>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</p>
            <p><em>The chicken pot pie filling starts with a roux made with butter and all-purpose flour.</em></p></li>
        <li><p>½ teaspoon salt</p></li>
            <p>¼ teaspoon black pepper</p>
            <p>¼ teaspoon celery seed</p>
            <p><em>Achieve the perfect cozy flavor with salt, pepper, and celery seed. Of course, you can add more seasonings to suit your taste.</em></p>
        </li>
        <li><p>1¾ cups chicken broth</p>
            <p>⅔ cup milk</p>
            <p><em>Chicken broth and milk add depth of flavor and help create a smooth and decadent chicken pot pie filling consistency.</em></p>
        </li>
        <li><p>2 (9 inch) unbaked pie crusts</p>
        <p><em>You'll need two unbaked pie crusts. If you opt for the homemade route, you can't go wrong with our <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/24094/butter-flaky-pie-crust/">Butter Flaky Pie Crust</a> recipe — but store-bought is perfectly fine.</em></p></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C.)</li>
        <li>Combine chicken, carrots, peas, and celery in a saucepan; add water to cover and bring to a boil. Boil for 15 minutes, then remove from the heat and drain.</li>
        <li>While the chicken is cooking, melt butter in another saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in flour, salt, pepper, and celery seed. Slowly stir in chicken broth and milk. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place chicken and vegetables in the bottom pie crust. Pour hot liquid mixture over top. Cover with top crust, seal the edges, and cut away any excess dough. Make several small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
